\section{Introduction}

Writing high-quality papers for top-tier computer security and systems conferences such as IEEE S\&P, USENIX Security, OSDI, and CCS is challenging.  
Reviewers demand exceptional clarity, concision, and technical precision.  
Most researchers lack access to professional editing support.  
This gap impedes effective scientific communication.  
We present an AI-assisted writing system that refines language and structure while preserving original technical content.  
Our system enforces the stylistic and rhetorical conventions of these venues.  
It enables authors to meet publication standards without specialist editorial input.
