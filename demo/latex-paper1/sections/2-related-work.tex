\section{Related Work}

Existing writing assistance tools, such as Grammarly, correct grammatical errors but ignore technical semantics and academic conventions specific to systems and security research.  
In contrast, large language models (e.g., GPT) demonstrate strong contextual understanding and text generation capabilities.  
We leverage these models to enforce the stylistic and technical norms of top-tier systems and security venues, thereby improving the quality of academic writing.
