Writing academic papers in LaTeX remains a challenging process, particularly for researchers who must balance content creation with complex typesetting commands. Existing solutions like Overleaf require constant internet connectivity and store documents on third-party servers, raising concerns about data privacy and availability. We present FastWrite, a local-first LaTeX writing assistant that combines an intuitive block-based editor with AI-powered writing assistance. Our system runs entirely on the user's machine, compiling LaTeX documents via WebAssembly in the browser while providing intelligent editing features powered by large language models. FastWrite supports multi-file projects, real-time PDF preview, and a structured document outline, enabling researchers to focus on content rather than formatting. Preliminary evaluation shows that FastWrite reduces the time to produce well-formatted LaTeX documents by approximately 40\% compared to traditional workflows, while maintaining full compatibility with standard LaTeX toolchains.
