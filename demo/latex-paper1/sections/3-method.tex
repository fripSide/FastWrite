\section{System Design}
FastWrite adopts a modular architecture to separate the frontend user experience from the heavy-lifting of text processing and LLM interaction.

\subsection{Overview}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:arch}, the system consists of a React-based frontend, a Bun.js local backend, and an intelligent prompting layer.

\subsection{Key Components}
\subsubsection{The Frontend}
The editor provides a split-view interface: the left panel handles file navigation, while the main area supports distraction-free editing.
The AI panel can be toggled to fullscreen for focused refinement sessions.

\subsubsection{Local Backend}
We utilize Bun.js for high-performance file I/O.

The backend monitors the file system for external changes (e.g., git pulls) and broadcasts updates to the frontend via WebSockets.
