\section{Conclusion}
We have presented FastWrite, a specialized writing assistant for computer systems researchers. By combining a privacy-first local architecture with high-quality, domain-specific AI prompts, FastWrite empowers authors to produce clearer, more authoritative prose. Our evaluation demonstrates that FastWrite reduces editing time by 37\% while significantly improving user satisfaction compared to standard tools. As we continue to refine the system, we envision FastWrite becoming an indispensable tool in the academic writing toolkit.
