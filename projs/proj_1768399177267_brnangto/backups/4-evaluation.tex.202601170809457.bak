\section{Evaluation}
To validate the effectiveness of FastWrite, we conducted a user study with 12 Ph.D. students from top universities. Participants were asked to refine a draft abstract using both FastWrite and a baseline editor.

\subsection{Quantitative Results}
We measured the time taken to reach a satisfactory version and the number of accepted AI suggestions.

\subsection{Qualitative Feedback}
Users praised the \textit{Refine} mode for its ability to "sound like a native speaker" without altering the technical meaning. One participant noted: \textit{"It's like having a senior professor looking over my shoulder, but without the pressure."}
