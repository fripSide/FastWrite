Writing high-quality academic papers in LaTeX is a challenging task that requires not only technical proficiency but also adherence to strict stylistic references. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting text generation, integrating them seamlessly into the LaTeX writing workflow remains an open problem. We present \textbf{FastWrite}, a novel local-first writing assistant designed specifically for computer systems researchers. FastWrite integrates a local backend server with a modern React-based frontend to provide real-time, context-aware writing assistance. Key features include \textit{Diagnose}, \textit{Refine}, and \textit{QuickFix} modes, which allow users to iteratively improve their drafts with granular control. We demonstrate that FastWrite significantly reduces the cognitive load of LaTeX editing and improves the overall quality of submissions.
