\section{Introduction}
The landscape of academic writing has undergone significant transformation with the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI).
However, for researchers in computer systems and security, the transition has been less than smooth.
### The Challenge

Producing top-tier conference papers, such as those for S\&P, OSDI, and CCS, demands a specific authoritative tone, precise terminology, and a rigorous logical flow. While tools like Overleaf excel in providing collaborative environments, they often lack deep integration with advanced AI assistance that can handle the nuances of academic LaTeX. This gap can hinder the efficiency and quality of the writing process, particularly in maintaining the high standards required by these prestigious conferences.
Generic LLM interfaces often produce verbose or hallucinatory text that requires extensive manual correction.
Furthermore, pasting sensitive drafts into cloud-based chatbots raises privacy concerns.

\subsection{Our Solution: FastWrite}
To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{FastWrite}, a privacy-focused, local-first LaTeX editor.
FastWrite bridges the gap between traditional editors and modern AI capabilities.
Unlike plugins that merely overlay text, FastWrite parses the LaTeX structure to offer context-aware suggestions.
Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep LaTeX Integration:} FastWrite understands sections, figures, and citations, ensuring that AI suggestions are syntactically correct and contextually relevant.
    \item \textbf{Granular AI Modes:} We propose three distinct interaction modes---Diagnose, Refine, and QuickFix---tailored to different stages of the writing process.
    \item \textbf{Local-First Architecture:} By running the backend locally, FastWrite ensures that the full paper draft never leaves the user's machine unless explicitly sent to an LLM provider for processing specific segments.
\end{itemize}
