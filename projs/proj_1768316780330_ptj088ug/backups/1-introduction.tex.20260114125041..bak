\section{Introduction}

The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the landscape of academic writing. However, for researchers in computer systems and security, this transition has been less than seamless.

### The Challenge

Producing top-tier conference papers for venues such as S&P, OSDI, and CCS requires a specific authoritative tone, precise terminology, and a rigorous logical flow. These elements are crucial for effectively communicating complex ideas and meeting the high standards of these prestigious conferences. While tools like Overleaf excel in providing collaborative environments, they often lack deep integration with advanced AI assistance that can handle the nuances of academic LaTeX. This deficiency can impede both the efficiency and quality of the writing process, making it challenging to maintain the high standards required by these conferences.

To address this, it is essential to integrate more sophisticated AI tools that can assist with the intricacies of academic writing. Such tools should not only enhance the collaborative features of platforms like Overleaf but also provide real-time feedback on structure, clarity, and technical accuracy. This integration would help authors produce papers that are not only technically sound but also well-structured and clearly articulated, thereby increasing their chances of acceptance at these highly competitive venues.

Generic large language model (LLM) interfaces often generate verbose or hallucinatory text, which requires extensive manual correction. Additionally, pasting sensitive drafts into cloud-based chatbots raises significant privacy concerns. These challenges underscore the need for more sophisticated and secure AI tools that can support the unique requirements of academic writing in computer systems and security.
\subsection{Our Solution: FastWrite}
To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{FastWrite}, a privacy-focused, local-first LaTeX editor.
FastWrite bridges the gap between traditional editors and modern AI capabilities.
Unlike plugins that merely overlay text, FastWrite parses the LaTeX structure to offer context-aware suggestions.
Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep LaTeX Integration:} FastWrite understands sections, figures, and citations, ensuring that AI suggestions are syntactically correct and contextually relevant.
    \item \textbf{Granular AI Modes:} We propose three distinct interaction modes---Diagnose, Refine, and QuickFix---tailored to different stages of the writing process.
    \item \textbf{Local-First Architecture:} By running the backend locally, FastWrite ensures that the full paper draft never leaves the user's machine unless explicitly sent to an LLM provider for processing specific segments.
\end{itemize}
