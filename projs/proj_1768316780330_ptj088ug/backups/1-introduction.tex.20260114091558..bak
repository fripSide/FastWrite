\section{Introduction}
The landscape of academic writing has evolved rapidly with the advent of generative AI. However, for researchers in computer systems and security, the transition has been less than smooth. Tools like Overleaf provide excellent collaborative environments but lack deep integration with advanced AI assistance that respects the nuances of academic LaTeX.

\subsection{The Challenge}
Writing top-tier conference papers (e.g., S\&P, OSDI, CCS) demands a specific authoritative tone, precise terminology, and rigorous logical flow. Generic LLM interfaces often produce verbose or hallucinatory text that requires extensive manual correction. Furthermore, pasting sensitive drafts into cloud-based chatbots raises privacy concerns.

\subsection{Our Solution: FastWrite}
To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{FastWrite}, a privacy-focused, local-first LaTeX editor. FastWrite bridges the gap between traditional editors and modern AI capabilities. Unlike plugins that merely overlay text, FastWrite parses the LaTeX structure to offer context-aware suggestions.

Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep LaTeX Integration:} FastWrite understands sections, figures, and citations, ensuring that AI suggestions are syntactically correct and contextually relevant.
    \item \textbf{Granular AI Modes:} We propose three distinct interaction modes---Diagnose, Refine, and QuickFix---tailored to different stages of the writing process.
    \item \textbf{Local-First Architecture:} By running the backend locally, FastWrite ensures that the full paper draft never leaves the user's machine unless explicitly sent to an LLM provider for processing specific segments.
\end{itemize}
