\section{Introduction}

The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the landscape of academic writing. However, for researchers in computer systems and security, this transition has been less than seamless.

### The Challenge

Producing top-tier conference papers for venues such as S&P, OSDI, and CCS demands a specific authoritative tone, precise terminology, and a rigorous logical flow. These elements are essential for effectively communicating complex ideas and meeting the high standards of these prestigious conferences. While tools like Overleaf excel in providing collaborative environments, they often lack deep integration with advanced AI assistance that can handle the nuances of academic LaTeX. This gap can hinder both the efficiency and quality of the writing process, particularly in maintaining the high standards required by these conferences.

Generic large language model (LLM) interfaces often generate verbose or hallucinatory text, which requires extensive manual correction. Additionally, pasting sensitive drafts into cloud-based chatbots raises significant privacy concerns. These challenges underscore the need for more sophisticated and secure AI tools that can support the unique requirements of academic writing in computer systems and security.
\subsection{Our Solution: FastWrite}
To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{FastWrite}, a privacy-focused, local-first LaTeX editor.
FastWrite bridges the gap between traditional editors and modern AI capabilities.
Unlike plugins that merely overlay text, FastWrite parses the LaTeX structure to offer context-aware suggestions.
Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep LaTeX Integration:} FastWrite understands sections, figures, and citations, ensuring that AI suggestions are syntactically correct and contextually relevant.
    \item \textbf{Granular AI Modes:} We propose three distinct interaction modes---Diagnose, Refine, and QuickFix---tailored to different stages of the writing process.
    \item \textbf{Local-First Architecture:} By running the backend locally, FastWrite ensures that the full paper draft never leaves the user's machine unless explicitly sent to an LLM provider for processing specific segments.
\end{itemize}
