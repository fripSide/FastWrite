\section{Introduction}

Writing high-quality papers for top-tier computer security and systems conferences remains challenging due to stringent reviewer expectations on clarity, concision, and technical precision. Most researchers lack access to professional editing support, creating a barrier to effective scientific communication. To address this gap, we present an AI-assisted writing system that refines language and structure while preserving the original technical content. Our system enforces the stylistic and rhetorical conventions of venues such as IEEE~S\&P, USENIX Security, OSDI, and CCS, enabling authors to meet these standards without expert editorial assistance.
