    We present FastWrite, an AI-driven system that automatically analyzes LaTeX manuscripts to enhance academic writing quality.  
    FastWrite processes standard scholarly documents in under 200\,ms with negligible overhead, enforcing clarity, concision, and adherence to academic conventions.  
    Evaluation on 1{,}200 peer-reviewed papers demonstrates a 37\% average reduction in stylistic ambiguities and a 28\% increase in syntactic precision, confirming its effectiveness in refining technical prose while integrating seamlessly into existing research workflows.
