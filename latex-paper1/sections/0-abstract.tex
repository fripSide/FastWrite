    We present FastWrite, an AI-driven system that enhances academic writing quality by automatically analyzing LaTeX manuscripts. FastWrite processes standard scholarly documents in under 200\,ms with negligible overhead, improving clarity, concision, and adherence to academic conventions. Evaluation on 1{,}200 peer-reviewed papers shows a 37\% average reduction in stylistic ambiguities and a 28\% increase in syntactic precision, demonstrating its effectiveness in refining technical prose while integrating seamlessly into existing research workflows.
